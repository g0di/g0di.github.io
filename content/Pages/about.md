Title: About
permalink: /about/

Hi folks,

I'm a software engineer for more than 10 years now.

I created this blog firstly for myself. As I was reading more and more articles related to software engineering, I was looking for a place to save those somewhere outside of my head (because I'm starting to lack space). I also wanted to be able to find back all those articles easily (Chromium reading list shown some limitations). I was also looking for a central place to keep some guides, templates and best practices.

In the other hands, I regularly face situations in my job where I want to share my knowledges and interesting reads with colleagues or clients. I wanted to have some kind of a personal knowledge database that I could freely keep up to date for myself and share to others as well. This is why this blog exist.

Don't hesitate to have a look on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-godard-0b40a7122/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/g0di) profiles and drop me a message!
