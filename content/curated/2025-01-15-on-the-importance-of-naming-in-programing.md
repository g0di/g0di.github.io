Description: This article explains why properly naming things in programming is really important and provides examples of bad and good names as well as structured steps to take to produce good names for things.
Summary: I heard about the importance of naming in programming a couple years ago while reading Uncle Bob's Clean Code book. But I found this article to provide interesting examples as well as some nice tips on how to help you actually naming things. It also emphasis on the fact that names heavily depends on context and can actually highlight "bad code" in some ways.
