Sometimes you want to build a web application but you're quickly discouraged because you know you'll have to write CSS so it does not look like crap.
If you're not CSS proficient you know it can be challenging (even using some existing frameworks).
I present you Simple CSS, a very simple css framework (mostly classless) to use on your website to make it just looks good.
