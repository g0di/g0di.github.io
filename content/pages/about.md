Hi folks,

My name is Benoît Godard but my friends call me Gody (pronounced as _godee_). I'm a software engineer for more than 10 years now and I'm passionated with programming, computer engineering, video games and movies/TV shows.

I created this blog firstly for myself. As I was reading more and more articles related to software engineering, I was looking for a place to save those somewhere outside of my head (because I'm starting to lack space). I also wanted to be able to find back all those articles easily (Chromium reading list shown some limitations). I was also looking for a central place to keep some guides, templates and best practices.

In the other hands, I regularly face situations in my job where I want to share my knowledges and interesting reads with colleagues or clients. I wanted to have some kind of a personal knowledge database that I could freely keep up to date for myself and share to others as well. This is why this blog exist.

You'll find two categories of articles on my website, [_Articles_]({category}articles) and [_Curated_]({category}curated). The former contains all the articles I personally wrote while the latter list all interesting articles I've read from other peoples that I want to keep and share. Concerning curated articles I made the choice to mention the author name and respectfuly link them directly to the author website.

Finally, all articles are tagged with one or several keywords. You can find all keywords and their related articles on the [tags](/tags.html) page.

Don't hesitate to have a look on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-godard-0b40a7122/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/g0di) profiles and drop me a message!
