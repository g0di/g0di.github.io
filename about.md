Hi folks,

My name is Beno√Æt and I'm a software engineer for more than 10 years now.

I created this blog firstly for myself. As I was reading more and more articles related to software engineering, I was looking for a place to save those somewhere outside of my head (because I'm starting to lack space). I also wanted to be able to find back all those articles easily (Chromium reading list shown some limitations). I was also looking for a central place to keep some guides, templates and best practices.

In the other hands, I regularly face situations in my job where I want to share my knowledges with colleagues or clients. I wanted to have some kind of a personal knowledge database that I could freely keep up to date for myself and share to others as well. This is why this blog exist.

Please note that everything written here is based on my own personal thoughts. You'll proably find lot of subjective stuff and I'm not suggestive to hold the absolute truth.

Don't hesitate to have a look on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-godard-0b40a7122/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/g0di) profiles and drop me a message!
